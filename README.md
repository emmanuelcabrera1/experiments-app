# Experiments Web

## Intent
The **Experiments Web** project is a Progressive Web App (PWA) designed as a sandbox for testing new web technologies, UI prototypes, and accessibility patterns before they are integrated into production applications.

## Key Features
- **PWA Capabilities**: Offline support, Service Workers, and installability.
- **Diagnostic Tools**: Built-in debug console and diagnostic pages.
- **UI Playground**: Gallery of experimental UI components.

## Structure
- `index.html`: Main entry point.
- `docs/`: Audits and project documentation.
- `tests/`: Diagnostic and test files.
- `js/`: Application logic.
- `css/`: Styles and themes.

## Getting Started
Open `index.html` in a modern browser. To test PWA features, serve the directory via HTTP (e.g., using Live Server).
