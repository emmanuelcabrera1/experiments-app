# Experiments Web

## Intent
The **Experiments Web** project is a Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to help users track their life experiments using the Tiny Experiments Framework. It serves as both a practical productivity tool and a sandbox for testing new web technologies, UI prototypes, and accessibility patterns.

## Key Features
- **PWA Capabilities**: Offline support, Service Workers, and installability.
- **Experiment Tracking**: Track experiments with mood logging, streaks, and insights.
- **Diagnostic Tools**: Built-in debug console and diagnostic pages.
- **Accessibility First**: WCAG AA compliant with comprehensive audit documentation.

## Structure
- **`index.html`**: Main entry point.
- **`docs/`**: Documentation and audits.
- **`tests/`**: Diagnostic tools.
- **`css/`**: Stylesheets.
- **`js/`**: Application logic and service workers.
- **`assets/`**: Static assets (PWA icons).
- **`sw.js`**: Service Worker definition.
- **`manifest.json`**: Web App Manifest.

## Documentation
- **`docs/ACCESSIBILITY_AUDIT.md`**: Audit reports and accessibility improvements.
- **`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`**: System map and technical stack.
- **`docs/AGENT_CONTEXT.md`**: High-efficiency context for AI Agents.
- **`docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`**: Manual for adding experiments and debugging.

## Getting Started
Open `index.html` in a modern browser. To test PWA features, serve the directory via HTTP (e.g., using Live Server).
